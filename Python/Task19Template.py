'''Capstone template project for FCS Task 19 Compulsory task 1.
This template provides a skeleton code to start compulsory task 1 only.
Once you have successfully implemented compulsory task 1 it will be easier to
add a code for compulsory task 2 to complete this capstone'''

#=====importing libraries===========
'''This is the section where you will import libraries'''

#====Login Section====
'''Here you will write code that will allow a user to login.
    - Your code must read usernames and password from the user.txt file
    - You can use a list or dictionary to store a list of usernames and passwords from the file.
    - Use a while loop to validate your user name and password.
'''

r - Registering a user
a - Adding a task
va - View all tasks
vm - view my task
e - Exit

        - You can follow the following steps:
            - Request input of a new username
            - Request input of a new password
            - Request input of password confirmation.
            - Check if the new password and confirmed password are the same.
            - If they are the same, add them to the user.txt file,
            - Otherwise you present a relevant message.'''

        - You can follow these steps:
            - Prompt a user for the following: 
                - A username of the person whom the task is assigned to,
                - A title of a task,
                - A description of the task and 
                - the due date of the task.
            - Then get the current date.
            - Add the data to the file task.txt and
            - You must remember to include the 'No' to indicate if the task is complete.'''

         print to the console in the format of Output 2 presented in the L1T19 pdf file page 6
         You can do it in this way:
            - Read a line from the file.
            - Split that line where there is comma and space.
            - Then print the results in the format shown in the Output 2 in L1T19 pdf
            - It is much easier to read a file using a for loop.'''
